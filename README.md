# R Intermediate Tidyverse 2023

This workshop is being offered in-person in July 2023 by [Northwestern IT Research Computing and Data Services](https://www.it.northwestern.edu/departments/it-services-support/research/).

We will cover the following topics:

1. Joining together datasets (dplyr-join.Rmd)
2. Reshaping/pivoting datasets (tidyr.Rmd)
3. Writing functions (Writing_functions.qmd)

This workshop builds on, and assumes knowledge of, [Intro to Tidyverse](https://github.com/nuitrcs/R-intro-tidyverse-2023).  Specifically, it assumes participants are familiar with the core dplyr functions of select, filter, mutate, summarize, group_by, and the %>% operator.
