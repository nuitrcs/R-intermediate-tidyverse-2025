# R Intermediate Tidyverse

This workshop is being offered in-person by [Northwestern IT Research Computing and Data Services](https://www.it.northwestern.edu/departments/it-services-support/research/).

We will cover the following topics:

1. Joining together datasets (`1_dplyr_join.qmd`)
2. Reshaping/pivoting datasets (`2_tidyr_pivot.qmd`)
3. Writing functions (`3_writing_functions.qmd`)

This workshop builds on, and assumes knowledge of, [Intro to Tidyverse](https://github.com/nuitrcs/R-intro-tidyverse-2023).  Specifically, it assumes participants are familiar with the core dplyr functions of select, filter, mutate, summarize, group_by, and the %>% operator.
